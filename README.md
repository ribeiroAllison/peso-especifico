# Specific Weight Calculator for Metal Wires

![alt screenshot of the program](/resources/img/program.JPG "Screenshot")

## What is it?

This project is a metal wire density calculator. It will be used by a cable factory to calculate the ammount of metal required to manufacture any given cable.

## How it works?

The program takes in four parameter and delivers two results based on them. 

> The parameters received are:

1. The type of metal, between three options ` CCAM (aluminum), Steel or Cooper  `
2. The diameter of the wire.
3. The ammount of wires of the same diameter that will used to manufacture the cable.
4. The total length of the finished product.

> Based on these 4 parameters two results will be calculated:

1. The density ` measured in kg/km ` of one metal wire that fits the criteria.
2. The total metal weight that will be present in the finished cable.
