# Specific Weight Calculator for Metal Wires

```

```
## What is it?

  

This project is a metal wire density calculator. It will be used by a cable factory to calculate the ammount of metal required to manufacture any given cable.

  

## How it works?

  

The program takes in four parameter and delivers two results based on them.

  

> The parameters received are:

  

1. The **type of metal**, between three options ` (CCAM (aluminum), Steel or Cooper) `

2. The **diameter** of the wire.

3. The **ammount of wires** of the same diameter that will used to manufacture the cable.

4. The total length of the finished product.

  

> Based on these 4 parameters two results will be calculated:

  

1. The **specific weight**` (measured in kg/km) ` of one metal wire that fits the criteria.

2. The **total metal weight** that will be present in the finished cable.

## Information flow and logic
This is the flow of information to get the desired outpus:

```mermaid

graph TB

A[Type of Metal input] --> B[Metal Diameter Input] -- calculate area --> 
C(Area) -- multiply by--> D(CCAM density) 
C -- OR--> E(Cooper Density)
C -- OR--> F(Steal Density)
D --> G{Specific weight output}
E --> G
F --> G

G --multiply by--> H(wire quantity)

H --> I{Total metal weight output}

```
